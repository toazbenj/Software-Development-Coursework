Here is an example project from the software development class I took recently. For our first project we collaborated in a group of 5 to produce a sudoku game identical to the example application over the course of a month. We used wxWidgets, CMake, and Git tools to make our application while operating with scrum methodology. Our team received full marks for our application and extra credit for winning a contest for the most creative level 3, where we had free reign to design it however we liked. Naturally we took the opportunity to poke fun at our professor. . .

You can play the game by forking this repo and rebuilding the project or launch the finished version of ActionSudoku.exe located in the root directory for your convenience.
